** Steckemacs

An Emacs configuration that integrates around 60 modes (packages). Stock Emacs is not very useful and lacks many convenient commands. Over the years I've discovered many good extensions and added them to this setup. The goal is to keep everything in one file =steckemacs.org= (plus =.emacs= for the initialization) and not as many others to split it over lots of files and directories. Packages are retrieved from the Emacs package repositories on the internet on the first startup.

If you want to know more about how that works, read my blog entry here:  [[http://steckerhalter.co.vu/blog/201304/steckemacs]]

*To use this setup please use Emacs 24 or later. Older versions do not work properly.*

*** Installation

Change to a directory of your choice and clone *steckemacs*:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  cd <my directory>
  git clone https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs.git
#+END_SRC

And symlink =.emacs= into your home directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  cd ~
  ln -s <path to the directory from above>/.emacs
#+END_SRC

That's it. Then you can run emacs and it should pick up the config, install all the packages and make you happy ;)
*** Keyboard shortcuts

By using the =key-chord= mode we can avoid having to type C- or M- all the time. It allows for using keys pressed simultaneously and I'm using it quite often.

When I write =fg= as a key combo it means you would have to press =f= and =g= at the same time.

I only describe my custom key combinations currently. To learn the standard Emacs commands, go through the Tutorial =C-h t=, use =C-S-h= or =M-x= to see/filter the available commands/shortcuts.

*** Contributions

I'm using *org-mode* to manage *steckemacs*. =.emacs= loads =steckemacs.org=, exports all the code blocks to =steckemacs.el= and loads that file to initialize *emacs*. =steckemacs.org= also contains this documentation which is used to generate =README.org= by calling:

You can find more information about *Literate Programming* and *org-mode* here: [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html#literate-programming]]

If you want to help me out improving the config, fork the repo, create a new branch and open up a Pull Request so we can discuss the merge.

Of course you can also just [[https://github.com/steckerhalter/steckemacs/issues][report issues]] :)
